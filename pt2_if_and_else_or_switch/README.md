# If and Else or Switch - Exercises

## Exercise 1

### a > Condition

In `./exercise-1.js`, write an `if` statement which assesses the value of `colour`, if it is `"green"`, sensitive to case; output `"Colour is great!"`. If it does not, output `"Colour is unknown"`.

Change the value of `colour` around to see all the different outputs.

### b > Joining Conditions

In your code for `./exercise-1.js`, join another condition to assess whether `colour` is `"red"`, irrelevant of case; output `"Colour isn't nice"`.

Change the value of `colour` to `"RED"` and see if you receive the correct output.

### c > Another Condition

In your code for `./exercise-1.js`, join another condition to assess whether `colour` is `"orange"`, irrelevant of case; output `"Colour is great!"`.

Change the value of `colour` to `"orange"` and see if you receive the correct output.

### d > DRY Code

Look at your code from `./exercise-1.js`, you have repeated yourself with outputting `"Colour is great!"`, using logical conditional operators, neaten your code so you only output `"Colour is great!"` once in your code.

Test with changing colour a few times to check if it still works.

## Exercise 2 - Switch

Look at the code in `./exercise-2.js`, replace the redundant `else if` chain with a switch statement which works identically.

Test your code by altering the value of `animal` and running the script.

## Exercise 3 - Switchy Trick

Look at the code in `./exercise-3.js`, find a way to replace the current `else if` chain with a switch statement which works identically.

Test your code by running it a few times and verifying its correct.
