# Scope, Importing & Exporting

## Exercise 1 - Scope

Take a look at `./exercise-1.js`, all variables have been defined as global. This isn't good, make changes to the declarations of the variables to fix the scope.

## Exercise 2 - Importing and Exporting

Take a look at the `./exercise-2*.js` files, make the necessary changes so that `./exercise-2b.js` can be run without an error being raised. You can choose to use ES5 or ES6 importing/exporting.

*Note: that if you choose to use ES6 importing/exporting, you will have to install the necessary modules to use it successfully. Look into 'esm', which you can install with npm*
